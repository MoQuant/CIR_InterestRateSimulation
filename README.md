# Cox-Ingersoll-Ros Stochastic Interest Rate Model

## Description
This repository contains Python and C code which simulates interest rates with given historical parameters and is used to calculate the price of a bond. The Python code computes the parameters off historical interest rate data and the C code uses its power to run the interest rate simulation
